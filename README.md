It is basically a recipe calculator written at haskell that does the functions below
1- Calculate how much the given amount of the given ingredient costs
2- Given a list of how much you already have of each ingredient, calculate how much of which ingredients are missing for a recipe
3- Given a list of ingredients in your kitchen, calculate what you would have left after making the given recipe. 
   If there isn't enough of an ingredient, the recipe cannot be made! In that case the amount of ingredient does not change.
4- Given a list of ingredients you already have, and a list of recipes, make a shopping list showing how much of each ingredient you need to buy, and its cost. 
   Each ingredient mush appear in the shopping list at most once (no duplicates!).
